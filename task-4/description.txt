- Created two tables: Customers and Orders with a foreign key relationship on CustomerID.
- Inserted sample data where some customers have orders and some do not.
- INNER JOIN shows only customers with matching orders.
- LEFT JOIN shows all customers, including those without orders (NULLs in order columns).
