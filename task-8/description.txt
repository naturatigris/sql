- Non-recursive CTE (DeptAvg): Simplifies a multi-step query by first calculating average salaries by department, then filters departments with average > 60000.
- Recursive CTE (OrgHierarchy): Traverses hierarchical employee-manager relationships starting from the top (CEO), using UNION ALL with a self-join.
- The recursive CTE builds levels in the hierarchy and stops when no more child records are found (avoiding infinite loops).
