- Created an Employees table with sample employee data including department and salary.
- First query ranks employees within each department by descending salary using the RANK() window function and PARTITION BY Department.
- Second query uses LAG() and LEAD() functions:
   - LAG() fetches the previous employee’s salary (within the same department, ordered by salary).
   - LEAD() fetches the next employee’s salary (within the same department, ordered by salary).
- These functions help in analyzing salary progression within departments.
