- Created an Employees table with sample salary data across departments.
- First query filters employees whose salary is above IT department’s average (non-correlated subquery).
- Second query shows each employee with the company’s average salary in a dynamic column (scalar subquery).
- Third query compares each employee’s salary to their own department’s average (correlated subquery).
